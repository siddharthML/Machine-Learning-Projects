    "# Assignment 2\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this assignment you will build the first stage of a biomedical event extractor. Biomedical events are state changes of biomolecules. For example, if you have a protein and you add a phosphate (PO4) group to it, this is referred to as a phosphorylation event. Many papers in the biomedical literature mention such events. The grand goal of biomedical event extraction is to teach machines how to read this literature and produce structured representations of biomedical events that biomedical researchers can query effectively. This task has received considerable attention in the NLP literature, and is the topic of a biennial [shared task](http://2011.bionlp-st.org/). We will use the data from this task as starting point for this assignment.   \n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate biomedical event extraction, let us consider an example. From the sentence \n",
    "\n",
    "> **phosphorylation** of TRAF2 **inhibits** **binding** to the CD40 domain\n",
    "\n",
    "we could extract the structure \n",
    "\n",
    "> Negative_Regulation(Phosphorylation(TRAF2), Binding(TRAF2, CD40)\n",
    "\n",
    "and store it in a database. Someone can then query this database, for example, to figure out all ways to prevent binding of TRAF2 to CD40.\n",
    "\n",
    "The task is often divided into two steps. First you need to find **trigger** words in the sentence that correspond to biomedical events, and determine their event type *label*. For example, in the above sentence \"phosphorylation\" is a trigger word for an event of type \"Phosphorylation\", \"inhibits\" a trigger word for a \"Negative Regulation\" event, and \"binding\" a trigger for a \"Binding\" event. Notice that sometimes the type labels are obvious, but often they are not. Also note that the label of a word could be \"None\". For example, the word \"of\" in the above sentence has the label \"None\".  \n",
    "\n",
    "The second step requires the extractor to produce **argument relations** between event triggers and protein mentions or other event triggers. For example, in the above case the argument of \"phosphorylation\" is \"TRAF2\", and one argument of \"inhibits\" is \"phosphorylation of TRAF2\" whereas the other is \"binding to the CD40 domain\". In this assignment you **do not have to do this**. We will focus on the event trigger detection problem exclusively. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "Your goal is to develop an event trigger labeler. This extractor is given a sentence and a candidate token. Both constitute the input $\\x$. One such input could be: \n",
    "\n",
    "> $\\x$: phosphorylation of TRAF2 **inhibits** binding to the CD40 domain\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to predict the label $y$ of the candidate event trigger. In the above case the label would be $y=\\text{Negative_Regulation}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some candidates may not refer to event triggers at all. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "> $\\x$: phosphorylation **of** TRAF2 inhibits binding to the CD40 domain\n",
    "\n",
    "In such cases the label is $y=\\text{None}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Resources\n",
    "To develop your model you have access to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The data in `data/bionlp/train`. This data can be split into training and dev set (as done below), or used for cross-validation.\n",
    "* Helper code stored in the python module [bio.py](/edit/statnlpbook/bio.py).\n",
    "* Libraries on the [docker image](https://github.com/uclmr/stat-nlp-book/blob/python/Dockerfile) which contains everything in [this image](https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks/tree/master/scipy-notebook), including scikit-learn and tensorflow. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we have to run the notebooks of all students, and because writing efficient code is important, **your notebook should run in 5 minutes at most**, on your machine. Further comments:\n",
    "\n",
    "* We have tested a possible solution on the Azure VMs and it ran in about 30s, so it is possible to train a reasonable model on the data in reasonable time. If you find training times too long for your development cycle you can reduce the training set size. Once you have found a good solution you can increase the size again. Caveat: model parameters tuned on a smaller dataset may not be optimal for a larger training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Try to run your parameter optimisation offline, such that in your answer notebook the best parameters are already set and don't need to be searched. Include your optimisation code in the notebook, but don't call it at each notebook run."

   "source": [
    "## Hint\n",
    "While you do not need to predict the arguments of an event, it is important to understand how trigger labels relate to the syntactic and semantic arguments of the trigger word. Features that can capture this relation might help you in improving the result. Do inspect the data and try to get an understanding of it. That said, you don't have to be a biomedical expert to do well in this task. A few of the best results on the task were achieved by NLP researchers without any biomedical experience. They would, however, still inspect the data carefully.  "

The features I used are primarily motivated by the Turku Event Extraction System (TEES) developed in [*Bjorn (2009)*](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W/W09/W09-1402.pdf), which was the best performer in BioNLP’09 Shared Task. The TEES system took extensive advantage of syntactic dependency parse graphs of a sentence to derive a rich set of features. I also tried a list of regularized expression, the idea for which was motivated by [*Li et al.2013*](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W13-2015)."

This provided a good direction in building my next set of variables where I introduced new features such part of speech tagging, word labels, trigger candidates and protein counts into my child dependency. I iterated the process one step further by introducing the grandchild feature function which also contained the same set of variables. The outcome in terms of increased accuracy was quite favorable. I next created a feature function taking into account parent dependency but this did not have significant results on the overall accuracy of my classifier. Hence, I saw no reason to further include grandparent dependency.\n",

Marginal increase in accuracy was gained from including regularized feature expressions such as special characters (“-“, “/”, “\\”) and numbers (0-9).

This is especially egregious since out dataset is **unbalanced** in favor of \"None\" labels. “None” category contains majority of labels in our corpus (64706 out of 71896), thus putting significant downward strain on our final F1 score. \n",

Another way to improve our model would be to feature engineer variables that take into account more of the variation in \"None\" labels. On the classifier side, semi-supervised models would be better suited in teasing out the distribution structure in this category. "
